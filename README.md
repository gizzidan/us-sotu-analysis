Text analysis of State of the Union Addresses

## Introduction
In this project, I performed text analysis on US Presidential State of the Union Speeches from 1790 to 2018. I accessed this data [through Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/state-of-the-union-corpus-1989-2017). Each speech is a text file with the President and year as the file name. I did this analysis because I am interested in discovering the most popular words, word networks, and how the sentiment changes through each century.

## Files
the .Rmd file is where all of the coding for the project is. I uploaded a few .csv files that include the SOTU for each century (1700s, 1800s, 1900s, 2000s).
